Can you tell me the latest step-by-step guide on how to setup an AWS account and deploy a model in Amazon Bedrock within the Amazon Bedrock platform.\". Note this process will involve requesting for model access to DeepSeek-R1 671B (this will usually be instantaneous) and you will also likely need to request to increase the quotas for tokens-per-minute (TPM) and requests-per-minute (RPM) which by default are set at low levels (this will usually take 1-3 business days). When doing these steps, you will obtain the value for the parameters `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` below from the IAM console on your AWS account."

    "Then, the `system_message` variable below needs to **STRICTLY** include the following: \"You are an assistant with access to specific tools.

For the {'corresponding'} tool, provide the {user message} as a string into the {'user message'} argument in the tool or any {'predefined values'} as a string for other arguments in the tool.\"\n",

For the 'calculator' tool, provide the user provided math expression as a string into the 'expression' argument in the tool.\"\n",
